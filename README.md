# Eric M. Shen 🎿

Hello! I am an undergraduate at Harvard University studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, and considering attaining a concurrent Master's in Statistics. I originally hail from Toronto and use the he series. As one part of my academic and extracurricular interests, I'm always interested in working with code and learning new things in doing so. Although not all the code I write is on Github; this showcases a few things I've worked on through the semesters.

Outside of classwork, I enjoy...
- 📰 Getting [up to date](https://news.ycombinator.com/) with [what's happening in the world](https://ground.news/)
- 🤝 Doing [consultancy work](https://www.harvardconsulting.org/) with leading businesses
- 🎹 Concert-going and discovering [new music](https://open.spotify.com/user/mcjmy0h6k1c0g8pfmselhlbfs?si=38eb74cdf2784593)
- 🏃 Snow sports, running, road and mountain biking

My interests are bound to change as the months progress, and as I continue exploring the different trends dominating computer science and tech.
